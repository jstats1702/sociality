# Bayesian Sociality Models: A Scalable and Flexible Alternative for Network Analysis

This repository contains all the necessary code to reproduce the results presented in the paper *Bayesian Sociality Models: A Scalable and Flexible Alternative for Network Analysis*.

## Implementation notes

- The implementation is carried out in R software version 4.4.2, using RStudio version 2024.12.0 Build 467 as the IDE, and executed on a standard laptop equipped with an 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 processor (2.80 GHz) and 8.00 GB of RAM.

- The user should expect some variation in computation time, particularly when running on different hardware configurations.

- To ensure the software runs properly, the user should place all files in a single folder and update the file path specified at the beginning of each script.

- The user must have the following libraries installed in the global environment to avoid any potential runtime conflicts: Rcpp, RcppArmadillo, igraph, sand, coda, ggplot2, reshape2, gridExtra, cluster, mclust.
